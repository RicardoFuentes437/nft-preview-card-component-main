## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I've never worked with overlays before so it was nice to get an introduction to them and to learn a little bit about how to implement them.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about overlays and all the different ways i can use them, for example using animations to make the overlay pop out in a better looking way.

### Useful resources

- [Overlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) - This video helped to understand a little bit how overlays work and how to implement them.
